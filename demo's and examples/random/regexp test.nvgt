//I was messing around with regular expressions. You see, a part of it is GPT generated, but it works good. The reason why I put this here is that for a long time, I had no clue how to use them and what they were good for, and this is a pretty good example to figure it out.
void main() {
    // Regular Expression to check if the name is more than 3 characters long and contains only letters and digits
    regexp re("^[a-zA-Z0-9]{4,}$");

    string compare = input_box("Text", "Enter the name to check against the regular expression.");

    bool matches = re.match(compare);
    alert("The regular expression", matches ? "matches the name requirements" : "does not match the name requirements");
}
