# Utils and examples for [the Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit](https://nvgt.gg)
You can use these scripts for free. If you do so, credits to [Jonathan859](https://jonathan859.xyz) would be appriciated but are not required.

# Contribute
Everyone can contribute. I generally don't blame others for their code, so do I request not to blame me if the code showed of here is not the best.
It is not required, but welcome if you indent and comment your code, so we know whats going on in your scripts.

Have fun!
