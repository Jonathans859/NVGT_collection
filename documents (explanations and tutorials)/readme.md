# Documents
So whats that here?
This is a list of documents, explanations, etc, which I've collected over time. Most of them are by Sam Tupy or other people, written on the NVGT discord.
I put tutorials or explanations here that helped me to code features I was trying to do at that time. I hope they are helpful to you as well.
These documents aren't documenting any features of the NVGT framework or its general includes itself. They are trying to explane how to code certain features for your own game.
